    const text1 = "I am a petroleum engineer turned software engineer. After graduating from Louisiana State University, I worked as a petroleum engineer, performing and analyzing oil and gas well completions operations. This is where I realized how much I enjoyed programming and data analytics, as I was employing them to find solutions to everyday problems. This realization led me to attain a Software Engineering certification from Flatiron School, where I learned Javascript, Ruby, and applied them throughout a series of hands-on projects. Now, I am on the path to becoming an experienced software developer, and I plan to leverage my insatiable curiosity, ability to learn quickly, and knack for problem-solving while on this journey."

    const text3 = "Mountain biking is my favorite way to spend my spare time, even though I am currently living in Houston and there are no mountains in sight. The lack of elevation has led me to participate in gravel and road cycling more often. I am currently training for the 2021 Mid South Gravel 100, which is a 100 mile gravel race that takes place annually in Oklahoma. I hope to complete it, even though it might turn into 100 miles of pedaling through mud like it did last year due to inclement weather conditions."
